# Steemit Post Vote Slider and Past Payout Monetizer
*TamperMonkey Script*

Enables STEEMIT.com slider for steemians with at least 72SP, and allows monetizing posts after 7 days via comments!

*If you are using this script in conjunction with the "Hide Resteems" script...*

To avoid conflicts if using "Hide Resteems" (HR) with "Steemit Post Vote Slider and Past Payout Monetizer" (SPVS),
TamperMonkey *must load* HR first (ie. "Settings -> Position" should be lower for HR than for SPVS)!

For those with sub-100 SP, you must still use caution when voting more frequently,
lest you receive the dreaded "Bandwidth Limit Exceeded" notification!  For more information:
